			<h2>Digital Cameras</h2>
			<p>To capture an image, a digital camera has millions of <i>photosites</i>. During exposure these photosites recives photons and <i>charge build up</i>. At the end of the exposure this charge can be used to determin the brightness of the pixel.</p>
			<p>To create a coloured image, a <i>Bayer mosaic</i> is placed over the sensors, each filter has its own colour of <i>red, green or blue</i>, and each covers one photosites. This allows the <i>colour intensity</i> of each pixel to be determined.</p>
			<p>To reflect the way a human eye is <i>more sensitive to green light</i>, the <i>Bayer mosaic</i> consist of twice as many green filters than other colours.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Film Cameras</h2>
			<p>The camera film contains <i>silver-halide crystals</i>, these crystals act as photon detectors, although they also react to other kinds of radiation. The <i>silver-halide</i> grains are mixed with <i>sliver-nitrate</i> and <i>halide salts</i> to create different sizes, shapes and compositions, this will change their <i>surface area</i> and <i>light sensitivity</i>.</p>
			<p>Unmodified grains are only sensitive to <i>blue</i> lights (like how photosites are not colour sensitive), orgainic molecules known as <i>spectral sensitizers</i> are added to make the grains more sensitive to a specific colour.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Eye</h2>
			<p>The eye has 2 lenses, the un-squeezable <i>cornea</i> for coarse focusing and the <i>"lens"</i> for finer focusing. Muscles around the lens contracts to thicken it, reducing the focal length, allowing closer objects to be in focus. The pupil contracts and relaxes to <i>control the amount of light</i> to let it, preventing high light intensity from damaging the cells.</p>
			<p>There are millions of <i>rod</i> and <i>cone</i> cells on the retina, where rod cells are responsible for <i>monochromatic</i> (black and white) and cone cells are responsible for <i>colour</i> vision. Rod cells also works better in <i>low light</i> environment, loss of rod cells will cause <i>night blindness</i>.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Similarties</h2>
			<p>Both cameras and eyes form <i>real</i> image that is inverted, the orientation is then corrected by <i>the brain</i> or <i>some sort of software</i>.</p>
			<p>Also, both eyes and cameras use <i>electric pulses</i> to transfer information recieved for processing.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Differences</h2>
			<p>Photosites and grains for digital and film cameras are responsible for <i>both</i> brightness and colour (with <i>Bayer mosaic</i> filters), whereas rod and cone cells are responsible for (mainly) <i>brightness</i> and <i>colour vision</i> respectively.</p>
			<p>To keep to image in-focus, eyes has a stretchy lens, the <i>thickness</i> and <i>curvature</i> changes as it is pulled, (hopefully) creating a focused image on the retina. Cameras move the sensors or the lens back and forth to get a focused image on the sensors or the film.</p>
			<p>The human eye is <u>very well designed</u>, it has no depthh distortion, has an <b><i>epic</i></b> dynamic range as the cells are dynamically adjusted to the environment (mainly brightness). The human eye is also 24 times higher in resolution than the average cameras.</p>
			<p>However, the human eye only sees the centre 20 degrees in detail, and has a <i>blind spot</i> caused by the exiting nerve, all which a camera does not have. Cemeras can also have <i>wide</i> or <i>telephoto</i> lens (like in telescopes), and <i>multiple</i> of these lens to fit a specific purpose, which the human eye only have one coarse and one fine lens.</p>
