<ol><li>The gain of kinetic energy of the&nbsp;\(\alpha\)&nbsp;particle when it forms is sufficient to read the coulomb barrier, but not for it to sumount the barrier directly.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>wave nature</b>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;\(\alpha\)&nbsp;particle gives it a small probability of tunnelling through the barrier.</li></ol>
