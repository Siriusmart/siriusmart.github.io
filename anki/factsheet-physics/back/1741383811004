<ul><li><b>Work done on the motor </b>is equal to the&nbsp;<b>energy transferred to the load and surroundings</b>&nbsp;by the motor, as the kinetic energy of the motor remains constant.</li><li>The electrons needed to be&nbsp;<b>forced through the wires</b>&nbsp;of the coil&nbsp;<b>against the opposing force</b>&nbsp;on the electrons due to the motor's magnetic field.</li></ul>
