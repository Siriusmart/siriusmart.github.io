<ul><li>The electrical heater&nbsp;<b>has resistance</b>, the <b>work done on the heater</b>&nbsp;is transferred as thermal energy.</li><li>This happens because the charge carriers&nbsp;<b>collide repeatedly</b>&nbsp;with atoms to transfer energy to them.</li><li>So the atoms vibrate more and the resistor becomes hotter.</li></ul>
