As the applied frequency increases from zero<br><ul><li>The <b>amplitude of oscillations</b>&nbsp;of the system increases until it&nbsp;<b>reaches a maximum amplitude</b>&nbsp;at a particular frequency, and the amplitude decreases again.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>phase difference</b>&nbsp;between the displacement and periodic forces increases from zero to&nbsp;\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<b>maximum amplitude</b>, then from&nbsp;\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)&nbsp;to&nbsp;\(\pi\)&nbsp;as the frequency increases further.</li></ul>
