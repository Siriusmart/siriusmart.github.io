Use a video camera to&nbsp;<b>record the motion</b>&nbsp;of two balls A and B&nbsp;<b>released at the same time</b>&nbsp;- A released from rest and B was given an initial&nbsp;<b>horizontal projection</b>.<br><ul><li>The&nbsp;<b>horizontal position</b>&nbsp;of B&nbsp;<u>changes at a constant rate</u>. This shows that the horizontal component of B's <b>velocity is constant</b>.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>vertical position</b>&nbsp;of A and B changes at the same rate - this shows that A and B has the&nbsp;<b>same vertical velocity</b>&nbsp;at any instant.</li></ul>
