<ol><li>The shape of the projectile causes the air to flow faster over the top of the object than underneath it.</li><li>As a result, the<b> pressure of air&nbsp;</b>on the top surface is less than that on the bottom surface.</li><li>This&nbsp;<b>pressure difference</b>&nbsp;causes a lift force on the object.</li></ol>
