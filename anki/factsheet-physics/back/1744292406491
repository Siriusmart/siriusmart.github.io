<ol><li>The count rate due to&nbsp;<b>background radioactivity</b>&nbsp;is measured, this is the count rate without the source present.</li><li>The count rate is then measured with the source at a&nbsp;<b>fixed distance</b>&nbsp;from the tube without any absorber present. The background count rate is then subtracted from the count rate with the source present to give the&nbsp;<b>corrected count rate</b>&nbsp;from the source.</li><li>The count rate is then measured with the absorber in a fixed position between the source and the tube.</li><li>The corrected count rates with and without the absorber present can then be compared.</li></ol>
