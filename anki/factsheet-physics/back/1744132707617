<ul><li>Use&nbsp;<b>low-resistance windings</b>&nbsp;to reduced power wasted due to the heating effect of the current.</li><li>Use a <b>laminated core</b>&nbsp;to reduce&nbsp;<b>eddy currents</b>&nbsp;so the magnetic flux is as high as possible, and reduces the heating effect of the induced currents in the core.</li><li>Use a&nbsp;<b>soft iron core</b>&nbsp;to reduce power wasted through repeated magnetisation and demagnetisation.</li></ul>
