<ol><li>The&nbsp;<b>centre of mass</b>&nbsp;of the plank is&nbsp;<b>directly above the point of support</b>&nbsp;when it is in equilibrium.</li><li>The support force is equal and opposite to the weight.</li><li>If the plank is displaced slightly, the centre of mass is&nbsp;<b>no longer above the point of support</b>.</li><li>The weight therefore acts to turn the plank further from the equilibrium position.</li></ol>
