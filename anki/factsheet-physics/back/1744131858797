<ol><li>When the primary coil is&nbsp;<b>connected to a source</b>&nbsp;of alternating pd, an&nbsp;<b>alternating magnetic field</b>&nbsp;is produced in the core.</li><li>The field passes through the secondary coil, so an&nbsp;<b>alternating emf is induced</b>&nbsp;in the secondary coil by the changing magnetic field.</li></ol>
