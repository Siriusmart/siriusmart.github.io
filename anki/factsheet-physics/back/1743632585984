<ul><li>At low frequencies, all three polarisation mechanisms&nbsp;<b>alternate in phase</b>&nbsp;with the field.</li><li>As frequency increases, each <b>mechanism ceases to work</b>&nbsp;due to the <b>inertia of the particles</b> involved and&nbsp;<b>resistive forces</b>&nbsp;that oppose the motion of the dipole.</li></ul>
