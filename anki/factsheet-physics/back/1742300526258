<ol><li>At increasing distance from the surface, the gravitational field&nbsp;<b>becomes weaker</b>.</li><li>And the <b>gain of gravitational potential energy per metre of height</b> becomes less.</li><li>So away from Earth's surface, the equipotentials for equal increases of potential are&nbsp;<b>spaced further apart</b>.</li></ol>
