<ol><li>When the plates are&nbsp;<b>connected to a battery</b>, electrons&nbsp;<b>move through the battery</b>, and</li><li>Are forced from its <b>negative terminal </b>of the battery onto one of the plates, and</li><li>An equal <b>number of electrons</b>&nbsp;return to the battery via its <b>positive terminal</b>.</li><li>So each plate gains an&nbsp;<b>equal and opposite charge</b>.</li></ol>
