<ol><li>The acceleration of the object is&nbsp;<b>always equal to&nbsp;</b>\(g\)&nbsp;and is <b>always downwards</b>&nbsp;- the acceleration only affects the vercital motion of the object.</li><li>The <b>horizontal veloctiy</b>&nbsp;of the object is constant because the acceleration of the object does not have a horizontal component.</li><li>The motions in the horizontal and vertical directions are <b>independent of each other</b>.</li></ol>
