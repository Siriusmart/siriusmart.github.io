<ol><li>Charged particles are directed into one of the electrodes near the centre of the cyclotron.</li><li>The charged particles are&nbsp;<b>forced on a circular path</b>&nbsp;by the magnetic field, causing them to emerge from the electrode they were directed into.</li><li>As they cross into the other electrode, the alternating voltage reverses so they are&nbsp;<b>accelerated into the other electrode</b>&nbsp;where they are once again forced on a circular orbit.</li></ol>
