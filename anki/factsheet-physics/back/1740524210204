<ol><li>The speed of an object&nbsp;<b>released from rest</b>&nbsp;in a fluid&nbsp;<b>increases as it falls</b>.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>resultant force&nbsp;</b>on the object is the difference between its&nbsp;<b>weight</b>&nbsp;and the <b>drag force</b>.</li><li>As the <b>drag force increases</b>, the resultant force decreases - so the&nbsp;<b>acceleration decreases</b>&nbsp;as it falls.</li><li>If it containues falling, it attains&nbsp;<b>terminal speed</b>&nbsp;when the drag force on it is equal and opposite to its weight. Its<b> acceleration is zero</b>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;<b>speed remains constant</b>&nbsp;as it falls.</li></ol>
