<ul><li>Liquid and gas&nbsp;<b>can flow</b>, but solids can't.</li><li>This is because the atoms in a solid are&nbsp;<b>locked together&nbsp;</b>by strong force bonds, which the atoms are unable to break free from.</li><li>Whereas in liquid or gas, the molecules are&nbsp;<b>not locked together</b>&nbsp;because they have&nbsp;<b>too much kinetic energy</b>, and the force bonds are&nbsp;<b>not strong enough</b>&nbsp;to keep the molecules fixed to each other.</li></ul>
