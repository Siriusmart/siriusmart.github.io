<ol><li>Consider a variable force&nbsp;\(F\)&nbsp;acts on an object and causes it to move in the direction of the force. The work done for a small amount of distance&nbsp;\(\Delta s\)&nbsp;is&nbsp;\(\Delta W=F\Delta s\).</li><li>This is represented on a graph by the area of a strip under the line of width&nbsp;\(\Delta s\)&nbsp;and height&nbsp;\(F\)</li><li>The <b>total work done</b>&nbsp;is therefore the sum of the areas of all the strips.</li><li>Therefore area under the line of a force-distance graph represents the total work done.</li></ol>
