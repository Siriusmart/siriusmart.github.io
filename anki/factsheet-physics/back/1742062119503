<ul><li>The pressure of a gas on a surface is due to the the&nbsp;<b>gas molecules hitting the surface</b>.</li><li>Each impact causes a tiny force on the surface.</li><li>Because there is a <b>large number of impacts each second</b>, the overall result is that the gas exerts a&nbsp;measurable pressure on the surface.</li></ul>
