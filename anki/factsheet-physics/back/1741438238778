The heating effect of an electric current in any component is due to the&nbsp;<b>resistance of the component</b>.<br><br>The charge carriers&nbsp;<b>repeatedly collide</b>&nbsp;with the positive ions of the conducting material, there is a&nbsp;<b>net transfer of energy</b>&nbsp;from the charge carriers to the positive ions as a result of these collisions.
