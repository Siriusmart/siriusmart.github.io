<ol><li>When a particle of ionising radiation enters the tube, the particle&nbsp;<b>ionises the gas atoms</b>&nbsp;along its track.</li><li>The negative ions are attracted to the rod, and positive ions to the wall.</li><li>Ions accelerate and&nbsp;<b>collide with other gas atoms</b>, producing more ions, and so on.</li><li>Many ions are produced in a very short time, and discharged at the electrodes.</li><li>A&nbsp;<b>pulse of charge</b>&nbsp;passes around the circuit through a resistor, causing a&nbsp;<b>voltage pulse</b>&nbsp;which is recorded as a single count by the pulse counter.</li></ol>
