<ol><li>When a dielectric is placed between two oppositely charged plates, each molecules of the dielectric becomes&nbsp;<b>polarised</b>.</li><li>The surface of the dielectric near the positive plate <b>gains negative charge</b>, the other surface <b>gains positive charge</b>.</li><li>As a result,&nbsp;<b>more charge is stored</b>&nbsp;on the plates, because</li></ol><div>The positive side of the dielectric <b>attracts more electrons</b>&nbsp;from the battery onto the negative plate.</div><div>The negative side of teh dielectric&nbsp;<b>pushes electrons back</b>&nbsp;to the battery from the positive plate.</div>
