<ol><li>The light intensity is proportional to the&nbsp;<b>number of photons</b>&nbsp;incident on the cathode per second.</li><li>Because each photoelectron must have&nbsp;<b>absorbed one photon</b>&nbsp;to escape the metal surface.</li><li>The photoelectric current is therefore proportional to the intensity of the incident light.</li></ol>
