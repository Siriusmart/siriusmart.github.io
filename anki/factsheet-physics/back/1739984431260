<ol><li>The&nbsp;<b>centre of mass</b>&nbsp;of the object is <b>directly below the point of support </b>when the object is in equilibrium.</li><li>The <b>weight of the object</b> is considered to act at its centre of mass.</li><li>Thus the support force and the wheight are&nbsp;<b>directly equal and opposite</b>&nbsp;to each other when the object is in equilibrium.</li><li>When the object is displaced, the line of action of teh weight&nbsp;<b>no longer passes through the point of support</b>.</li><li>So the weight returns the object to equilibrium.</li></ol>
