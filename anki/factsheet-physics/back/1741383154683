<ul><li>In a semiconductor, the number of charge carriers&nbsp;<b>increases with an increase of temperature</b>.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>resistance</b>&nbsp;of a semiconductor therefore decreases with as temperature is raised.</li><li>Because conduction is due to electrons that break free from the atoms of the semiconductor.</li></ul>
