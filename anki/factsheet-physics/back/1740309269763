<ol><li>Because each electron in the beam is acted on by a&nbsp;<b>constant force</b>&nbsp;towards the positive plate, as the charge of an electron is negative.</li><li>Therefore each electron experiences a&nbsp;<b>constant accelerations</b>&nbsp;towards the positive plate.</li><li>And its motion parallel to the plates is at&nbsp;<b>zero acceleration.</b></li><li>Whereas its motion perpendicular to teh plates is at&nbsp;<b>constant acceleration</b>.</li></ol>
