<ol><li>Living plantes and trees contain a small percentage of the radioactive isotope of <b>carbon-14</b>.</li><li>Once a tree has died,&nbsp;<b>no further carbon is taken in</b>&nbsp;so the proportion of carbon-14 in a dead tree decreases as the carbon-14 nuclei decay.</li><li>Because <b>activity is proportional to the number of atoms</b> still to decay, measuring the activity of the dead sample enables its age to be calculated, provided the activity of the same mass of living wood is known.</li></ol>
