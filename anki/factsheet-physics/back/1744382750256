<ol><li>Ancient rocks contain&nbsp;<b>trapped argon gas</b>&nbsp;as a result of the decay of the radioactive isotope of potassium-40.</li><li>Using the&nbsp;<b>effective half-life</b>&nbsp;of the decay of potassium-40, the age of the rock can be calculated by measuring the proportion of argon-40 to potassium-40.</li></ol>
