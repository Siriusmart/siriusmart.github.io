Consider two progressive waves passing through each other.<br><ul><li>When they are&nbsp;<b>in phase</b>, they&nbsp;<b>reinforce each other</b>&nbsp;to produce a big wave.</li><li>A&nbsp;<b>quarter cycle</b>&nbsp;later, the two waves moved one-quarter wavelength in <u>opposite direction</u>. They are now in&nbsp;<b>antiphase</b>&nbsp;and cancels each other.</li><li>After a further&nbsp;<b>quarter cycle</b>, the two waves are back in phase. The resultant is again a large wave.</li></ul>
