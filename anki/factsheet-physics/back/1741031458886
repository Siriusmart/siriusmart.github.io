If an object of mass is raised through a vertical height&nbsp;\(\Delta h\)&nbsp;at steady speed, the force it needed to raise it is equal and opposite to its weight&nbsp;\(mg\)<br>\[\begin{align*}
W&amp;=F\times d\\
&amp;=mg\Delta h
\end{align*}\]The work done on the object increases its gravitational potential energy<br>\[E_P=mg\Delta h\]<br>
