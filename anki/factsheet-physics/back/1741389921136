A metal has&nbsp;<b>positive temperature coefficent</b>&nbsp;because its resistance increases with increase of temperature.<br><ul><li>The positive ions in the conductor&nbsp;<b>vibrate more</b>&nbsp;when its temperature is increased.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>charge carriers</b>&nbsp;therefore cannot pass through the metal as easily.</li></ul>
