<ul><li>An&nbsp;<b>ammeter</b>&nbsp;is used to measure the current through the resistor.&nbsp;<b>In series</b>&nbsp;with the resistor so the same current passes through both the resistor and the ammeter.</li><li>A&nbsp;<b>voltmeter</b>&nbsp;is used to measure the pd across the resistor.&nbsp;<b>Parallel</b>&nbsp;with the resistor so they have the same pd.</li><li>A&nbsp;<b>variable resistor</b>&nbsp;used to adjust the current and pd as necessary.</li></ul>
