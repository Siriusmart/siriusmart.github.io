<ol><li>If two protons and two neutrons inside a sufficiently large nucleus&nbsp;<b>bind together</b>&nbsp;as a cluster, they may be emitted from the nucleus as an&nbsp;\(\alpha\)&nbsp;particle.</li><li>Because the&nbsp;<b>binding energy</b>&nbsp;of an&nbsp;\(\alpha\)&nbsp;particle is very large compared to other neutrons and proton clusters that may form, the&nbsp;\(\alpha\)&nbsp;particle therefore <b>gains sufficient energy</b>&nbsp;to give it a small probability of quantum tunnelling from the nucleus.</li></ol>
