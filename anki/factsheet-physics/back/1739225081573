<ol><li><b>Ionisation and excitation</b>&nbsp;of mercury atoms occur as they collide with each other and with electrons in the tube.<br></li><li>The mercury atoms&nbsp;<b>emit ultraviolet photons</b>&nbsp;as well as photons of less energy when they de-excite.</li><li>The ultraviolet photons are&nbsp;<b>absorbed by the atoms of the fluorescent coating</b>, causing excitation of atoms.</li><li>The coating atoms&nbsp;<b>de-excit in steps</b>&nbsp;and emit visible photons.</li></ol>
