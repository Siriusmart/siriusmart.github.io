<ul><li>The molecules are&nbsp;<b>point particles</b>&nbsp;- the volume of each particle is negligible compared with the volume of the gas.</li><li>They&nbsp;<b>do not attract each other</b>.</li><li>They move about in&nbsp;<b>continual random motion</b>.</li><li>The collisions they undergo with each other and with the container surface are&nbsp;<b>elastic collisions</b>.</li><li>Each collision with the container surface is of&nbsp;<b>much shorter duration</b>&nbsp;than the time between impacts.</li></ul>
