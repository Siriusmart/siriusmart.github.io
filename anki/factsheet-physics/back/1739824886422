<ul><li>White light&nbsp;<b>split into the colours of the spectrum</b>&nbsp;when it enters a diamond.</li><li>Diamond has a&nbsp;<b>very high refractive index</b>&nbsp;so it separates the colours more than any other substance does.</li><li>The high refractive index gives a&nbsp;<b>small critical angle</b>&nbsp;- so a light ray in a diamond may totally internally reflect many times before it emerges, which means the colours spread out more and more.&nbsp;</li></ul>
