<ul><li>Photoelectric emission of electrons does not take place if the frequency of the incident electromagnetic radiation is below a certain value known as the&nbsp;<b>threshold frequency</b>.</li><li>The number of electrons emitted per second is&nbsp;<b>proportional to the intensity</b>&nbsp;of the incident radiation.</li><li>Photoelectric emission occurs&nbsp;<b>without delay</b>&nbsp;as soon as the incident radiation is directed at the surface.</li></ul>
