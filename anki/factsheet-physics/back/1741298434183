<ol><li>From 0 to the&nbsp;<b>limit of proportionality</b>, the tensile stress is proportional to the tensile strain.</li><li>Beyond the limits of proportionality, the line <b>curves</b>&nbsp;and continues beyond its&nbsp;<b>elastic limit</b>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<b>yield point</b>.</li><li>Beyond the yield point, a small increase in tensile stress causes a large increase in tensile strain as the material undergoes&nbsp;<b>plastic flow</b>.</li></ol>
