<ol><li>When a beam of&nbsp;<b>high-energy electrons</b>&nbsp;is directed at a thin solid sample of an element, the incident electrons are&nbsp;<b>diffracted by the nuclei</b>&nbsp;of the atoms in the foil.</li><li>A detector is used to measure the number of electrons per second diffracted through different angles.</li></ol>
