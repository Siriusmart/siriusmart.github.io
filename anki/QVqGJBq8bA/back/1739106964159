<ol><li>When light is incident on a metal surface, an electron at the surface&nbsp;<u>absorbs a single photon</u>&nbsp;from the incident light and therefore gains the energy of the photon&nbsp;\(E=hf\).</li><li>An electron can leave the metal surface if the <u>energy gained from a single photon</u>&nbsp;exceeds the&nbsp;<b>work function</b>&nbsp;of the metal.</li><li>Excess energy becomes the&nbsp;<b>kinetic energy</b>&nbsp;of the electron.</li></ol>
