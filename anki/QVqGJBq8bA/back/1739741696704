<ul><li>The amplitude of vibration is zero at the nodes so there is&nbsp;<b>no energy at the nodes</b>.</li><li>The amplitude of vibrations is maximum at the antinodes so there is&nbsp;<b>maximum energy at the antinodes</b>.</li><li>Because nodes and antinodes are at&nbsp;<b>fixed positions</b>, no energy is transferred from the wave pattern.</li></ul>
