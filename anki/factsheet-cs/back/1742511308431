Each cell works by<br><ol><li><b>Delivering a current</b>&nbsp;along the word lines to activate the&nbsp;<b>flow of electrons</b>&nbsp;from the source to towards the <b>drain</b>.</li><li>The current on the word line&nbsp;<b>forces a few electrons across the insuated oxide layer</b>&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<b>floating gate</b>.</li><li>Once the current is turned off, these&nbsp;<b>electrons are trapped</b>.</li></ol>
