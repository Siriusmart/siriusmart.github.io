The data in a block is used to&nbsp;<b>create a checksum</b>&nbsp;value which is&nbsp;<b>transmitted with the block</b>. The same algorithm is applied to the block after transmission.<br><ul><li>If the two checksums match, the transmission is deemed to have been successful.</li><li>Otherwise, an error must have occured during transmission, and the block should be&nbsp;<b>transmitted again</b>.</li></ul>
