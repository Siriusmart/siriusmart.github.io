When the CPU receives an interrupt signal.<br><ol><li>It&nbsp;<b>suspends execution</b>&nbsp;of the running program, and puts the value of each register and the program counter onto the&nbsp;<b>system stack</b>.</li><li>An&nbsp;<b>interrupt service routine</b>&nbsp;is called to deal with the interrupt - depending on the type of the interrupt, a particular routine is ran to service it.</li><li>Once the interrupt has been served, the original values of the registers are&nbsp;<b>retrieved from the stack</b>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<b>fetch-execute cycle resumes</b>&nbsp;from the point that it left off.</li></ol>
